Certainly! Here are 10 challenging JavaScript problems that only involve basic variables, if-else conditions, switch statements, arrays, functions, objects, and for and while loops, without any recursion, dynamic programming, or other data structures apart from arrays:

1. **Longest Word**: Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence (a string with spaces).

2. **Number Reversal**: Create a function to reverse a given integer (e.g., 1234 becomes 4321).

3. **Sum of Primes**: Write a function that calculates the sum of all prime numbers within a specified range.

4. **Object Filtering**: Given an array of objects with various properties, write a function that filters objects based on a specific property and its value.

5. **Palindrome Sentence**: Build a function to check if a given sentence is a palindrome (ignoring spaces and capitalization).

6. **Multiplication Table**: Generate a multiplication table as a 2D array, where `table[i][j]` contains the result of `i * j` for specified ranges.

7. **Find Duplicates**: Write a function to find and return the duplicate values in an array.

8. **Factorial without Recursion**: Implement a function to calculate the factorial of a number without using recursion or memoization.

9. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: Create a text-based game where a user plays against the computer. Use if-else conditions to determine the winner.

10. **Array Intersection**: Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array containing the common elements between the two.

11. **Array Manipulation**: Given an array of numbers, write a function that finds the two numbers that, when added, produce a specific target sum. Return the indices of these numbers in the array.

12. **Anagram Checker**: Write a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

13. **Prime Number Generator**: Develop a function that generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit.

14. **Sorting Algorithm**: Write a function to perform a custom sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quicksort) on an array of objects based on a specific property.

15. **Nested Loop Challenge**: Write a program that uses nested loops to generate a pattern, such as a pyramid of asterisks or numbers, based on user input.

16. **Shopping Cart**: Design a JavaScript program that simulates a shopping cart. It should allow users to add and remove items, calculate the total cost, and display the contents of the cart.

These problems will test your understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and require creative solutions using only basic variables, loops, and conditionals.
