Certainly! Here are 10 JavaScript problems to help you practice basic variables, if-else conditions, and switch statements:

1. **Even or Odd**: Write a program that takes a number as input and determines if it's even or odd.

2. **Maximum of Two Numbers**: Create a function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns the larger of the two. 

3. **Grade Calculator**: Write a program that takes a student's score as input and assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on the score. 

4. **Leap Year Checker**: Build a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not. 

5. **BMI Calculator**: Create a function that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. 

6. **Temperature Converter**: Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It should accept a value and a unit (C or F) and convert it to the other unit. 

7. **Factorial Calculator**: Build a function that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer. 

8. **Month Name**: Write a program that takes a number (1-12) as input and returns the corresponding month name. 

9. **Fruit Sorter**: Create a program that takes the name of a fruit as input and uses a switch statement to determine its category (e.g., citrus, berry, tropical). 

10. **Palindrome Checker**: Develop a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
    
These problems cover a range of basic programming concepts in JavaScript and should help reinforce your understanding of variables, if-else conditions, and switch statements. You can start with these and gradually increase the complexity as you become more comfortable with the language.
