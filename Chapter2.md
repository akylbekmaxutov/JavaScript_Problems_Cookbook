Great! Here are 10 JavaScript problems to help you practice your knowledge of arrays, functions (both classical and arrow), objects, and loops:

1. **Sum of Array**: Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

2. **Reverse String**: Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

3. **Find the Largest Number**: Write a function that finds the largest number in an array of numbers.

4. **Object Properties**: Create an object representing a person with properties like name, age, and city. Write a function to display these properties.

5. **Array Filter**: Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns a new array containing only the even numbers.

6. **Factorial with Recursion**: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

7. **Student Information**: Create an array of objects, each representing a student with properties like name, age, and grade. Write a function to find the student with the highest grade.

8. **Palindrome Checker**: Build a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome, considering spaces and capitalization.

9. **Array Manipulation**: Given an array of numbers, write a function to remove all occurrences of a specific number and return the modified array.

10. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Write a function that generates the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence and returns them in an array.

These problems cover a range of topics you've learned, including arrays, functions, objects, and loops. They provide a good foundation for building your skills and becoming more comfortable with these JavaScript concepts. You can gradually increase the complexity of these problems as you progress in your learning journey.
